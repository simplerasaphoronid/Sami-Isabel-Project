**Roles**
  As this is a project with only two team members, we do not have clearly defined roles right now. We have been communicating with each other when we get stuck with  anything or if we need support on troubleshooting. 

**Status Update**
  The team is doing fine. Weâ€™re anticipating the work due before the midterm in two weeks.

**Data update**
  We seem to have all data we need. We've added data on bus stop benches and metro bus lines to our group repository.
  We are having trouble downloading our [tree](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/trees-bureau-of-street-services)data.
  Depending on how accessing tree data goes, we might have to figure alternative data source for trees.

**Concerns**
  *Major concerns*
  1. We need to figure how to merge our tree data and with our bus stop data
  2. We are not sure if we can have census data with income as separate layers and tree data as separate layers on the same map.
  
  *Minor concerns*
  1. We wonder if our scale of analysis is too small to have any meaningful findings.
